## Polymorphism in C++

C++ supports two distinct, high-level forms of polymorphism: _runtime polymorphism_ and _compile-time polymorphism_. 

### Runtime Polymorphism

Runtime polymorphism is more an overarching concept rather than a single programming construct that we can point to. For instance, runtime polymorphism may be achieved through the some combination of interfaces, implementation inheritance, and object composition. 

### Compile-Time Polymorphism

Compile-time polymorphism in C++ is typically achieved via the use of templates.
