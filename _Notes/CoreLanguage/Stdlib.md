## The C++ Standard Library

### Static Arrays `std::array`

When should we use the C++ `std::array` class and when should we use raw C-style arrays?

Being that `std::array` is a class, it comes with some additional attributes, such as the `size()` method which maintains the total size of the array. Additionally, the `std::array` class will (optionally) perform some basic bounds checking for us. 

### Dynamic Arrays `std::vector`

### `std::functional`
